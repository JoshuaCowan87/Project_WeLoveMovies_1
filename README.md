# We Love Movies
Created database and inplemented REST API's as a sample project for a movie and critic review website. Since the focus of this project was exclusively backend, there is no front end component. I succesfully completed PostgreSQL database set up, migrations, seeding and SQL queries. Each query is set to mimic a search button or field, that would occur on a movie, critic and theatre website.

## Tech Stack
Backend: PostgreSQL, knex, Node.js, Express, CORS

## Improvements
First improvment for this project would be to create an front end, to show the results of each query. Some of the middleware in the controller files can be refactored. For the purpose of this project, I needed to write each middleware seperately.
